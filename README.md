Arduino Programmable Constant Current Power Resistance Load
===========================================================

This is all of the code, datasheets and design files for [my instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Programmable-Constant-Current-Power-Resist/ "Arduino Programmable Constant Current Power Resistance Load") 

* Arduino - It contains the Arduino code that we will be talking about here, within the dummy load folder. It also contains all of the 3rd party libraries I have used.
* Datasheets - It contains all of the datasheets for the major components used within the project.
* DesignSpark - I have used the opensource schematic and PCB design software for this project, its a fantastic free tool that has no limitations and I find it easier to uses than Eagle - http://www.rs-online.com/designspark/electronics/eng/page/designspark-pcb-home-page The rev 1 folder contains all of my initial designs, please don't use this as there are 2 or 3 errors in the footprints plus I have completely revised the layout for rev 2, please only use these files. the gerber files are in there should you wish to have your own board done. See the next step for more information on this.
* LTSpice - This contains all of the LtSpice files from simulating the operation of the MOSFET.

Please checkout my instructable as it describes all of this code and the operation of the dummy load.
